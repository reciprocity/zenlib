# Custom styles

This package is intended to have our Reciprocity custom styles.

## Usage

Each scss file can be imported individually:

```
@import "~@reciprocity/styles/scss/colors.scss";
```

And the way you import all the scss styles, it is importing the provided `scss/index.scss` file.

```
@import "~@reciprocity/styles/scss/index.scss";
```

This way, we can have our custom styles that we can share all across the apps.
You can use this package alongside with Bootstrap and BootstrapVue. 

The file `scss/colors.scss` has the [Design Team defined colors](https://share.goabstract.com/6feb26e0-e4ed-4ca4-94f4-fff47925522a?mode=build&sha=fc8a3c91035b5d7ff9a1dc0ebad4776094fddece).
