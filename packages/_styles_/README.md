# Custom styles

This package is intended to have our Reciprocity custom styles.

## Usage

Each scss file can be imported individually:

```
@import "~@reciprocity/styles/scss/colors.scss";
```

And the way you import all the scss styles, it is importing the provided `scss/index.scss` file.

```
@import "~@reciprocity/styles/scss/index.scss";
```

This way, we can have our custom styles that we can share all across the apps.
You can use this package alongside with Bootstrap and BootstrapVue.
